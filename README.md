# Gillette-Acquisition-Strategy

## Project Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis to estimate and infer the coefficients of long-term margin and sales multiple, denoted as A(Theta) and B(Theta), respectively. These parameters depend on the acquisition probability, Theta, and are critical for understanding Gillette's strategic advertising decisions. The project leverages nonlinear regression models and Monte Carlo methods to establish the relationships and confidence intervals.

## Objectives
Estimate A(Theta) and B(Theta): These coefficients reveal the impact of acquisition probability (Theta) on Gillette's long-term margin and sales multiple.
Determine 95% Confidence Intervals: Monte Carlo draws are used to find the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates.
Analyze Strategic Advertising Decisions: Investigate whether Gillette's management took the potential acquisition into account when making advertising spending decisions.

## Methodology
Estimation of A(Theta) and B(Theta):
A(Theta) Estimate: 73.62
B(Theta) Estimate: 4.80
These values reflect how acquisition probability affects long-term margin and sales multiple, influencing Gillette's valuation in acquisition scenarios.
## Confidence Intervals:
A(Theta) 95% CI: [30.54, 89.01]
B(Theta) 95% CI: [2.16, 6.44]
These intervals show potential variability in the coefficients, highlighting the uncertainties that Gillette considered.
## Strategic Advertising Decisions:
Strategic Spending: The relationship between advertising spending and revenue indicates that Gillette strategically used advertising to improve its financial metrics.
Influence of Theta: Theta's influence on A(Theta) and B(Theta) demonstrates Gillette's foresight in aligning advertising strategies with acquisition-focused metrics.
Confidence Interval Insights: The wide ranges in the 95% CIs reflect Gillette's awareness of risks and the optimization of their positioning for a potential acquisition.
## Conclusion
The results suggest that Gillette managers likely accounted for future acquisition possibilities in their advertising expenditures. The strategic use of advertising was intended to enhance the company's valuation metrics in acquisition contexts, showing a clear forward-looking strategy.
